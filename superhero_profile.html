      <p>Miles Gonzalo Morales is a fictional character, a superhero
        appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is one of the characters known as Spider-Man,
        having been created in 2011 by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli, with input by Marvel's
        then-editor-in-chief Axel Alonso. The character possesses powers similar to those of the original Spider-Man,
        which were derived from the bite of a spider genetically engineered by Spider-Man's nemesis Norman Osborn in
        an attempt to duplicate those abilities.</p>

        <p>Spider Physiology/OZ formula Enhancement: Miles Morales gained the
          proportionate abilities of a spider after being bitten by a spider which had been genetically-modified with
          the
          Oz formula.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Superhuman Strength: Miles possesses superhuman strength, making him capable of lifting at least 10 tons.
            His
            physical strength also extends into his legs, enabling him to be able to jump to a height of several stories
            in a single bound. He has to pull his punches and kicks, otherwise, his blows would prove fatal to a normal
            human. Like Peter Parker, in times of great duress, he sometimes displays far greater feats of strength.
            During the events of Secret Empire, after watching Black Widow's murder, Miles shattered Captain America's
            shield with a single punch. Even though the shield was in no way as durable as Rogers' classic Vibranium
            shield, it was still extremely durable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Superhuman Speed: Miles possesses the proportionate speed of a spider, therefore he can run and move at
            speeds that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete. Miles was able to move fast enough
            to reach an airplane as it took off,[155] and Assessor stated that he had a faster reaction than some attack
            drones.
          </li>
          <li>
            Superhuman Stamina: Spider-Man's advanced musculature produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity
            than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before
            fatigue begins to impair him. At his peak, Spider-Man can physically exert himself for several hours before
            the build-up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him.
