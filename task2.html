              died. Jack wanted his sons to be more successful than him. He impressed upon Matt the need to constantly
              study instead of playing sports with other kids. Jack hoped that Matt would become a doctor or a lawyer
              instead of an "uneducated pug" like himself. This led the neighborhood kids to bully the "cowardly" Matt
              as "Daredevil", while his twin brother came to his aid. Matt took out his frustrations by secretly
              training in his father's gym.</td>
