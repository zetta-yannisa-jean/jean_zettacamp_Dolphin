          Damn is the fourth studio album by American rapper Kendrick Lamar. Released on April 14, 2017, through
          Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records, critical accolades followed
          including a Pulitzer Prize for Music and the Best Rap Album at the 2018 Grammy Awards.
          Lamar assembled numerous artists and producers to produce the album, including executive producer and Top
          Dawg Entertainment label-head Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith, Sounwave, DJ Dahi, Mike Will Made It, and Ricci
          Riera, as well as further production contributions from James Blake, Steve Lacy, BadBadNotGood, Greg

          album, To Pimp a Butterfly. The album also incorporates elements of trap, contemporary R&B, and pop. Prior
          to the album's release, Lamar released a promotional single, "The Heart Part 4"

          SOS is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter SZA. It was released through Top Dawg
          Entertainment and RCA Records on December 9, 2022. The album features guest appearances from Don Toliver,
          Phoebe Bridgers, Travis Scott, and the late Ol' Dirty Bastard. SZA worked with a variety of record producers
          and songwriters such as Babyface, Jeff Bhasker, Benny Blanco, Rodney Jerkins, DJ Dahi, Ant Clemons and
          Lizzo. It serves as the follow-up to SZA's previous album Ctrl.
          The album was supported by six singles—"Good Days", "I Hate U", "Shirt", "Nobody Gets Me", "Kill Bill", and
          "Snooze". "Kill Bill" became SZA's first song to top the Billboard Hot 100, with all other singles falling
          within the top 15. Upon release, SOS received widespread critical acclaim for its eclectic sound and SZA's
          vocal delivery; several media publications ranked it as one of the best albums of 2022. To promote the
          album, SZA embarked on a North American and European arena tour, the SOS Tour, from February to October
          2023.
          The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200—SZA's first to do so—and broke the record for the
          largest streaming week for an R&B album in the US.
